# HealthCare_Data_Analysis
Exploring and getting insights of the data set having data of appointments of patients having different health related problems such as diabetes, hypertension etc

Introduction
The recent raise in health related issues has made it fundamental that everyone one has easy access to health care but its been discoved that despite provision of access patient may or may not show up for their appointments leading to hospital incuring losses on operating cost as salaries will be paid wether or not patient visit the hospitals as expected. This report tries to analyse the reason why patients dont show up for their appointments after scheduling one and providing possible solutions the hospitals can consider in improvoing their revenue.

Dataset used for this project was collected from Kaggle the dataset contains 110k medical appointments in Brazil, collected in May/June 2016 and its focused on characteristics of patients as well as their presence or absence from scheduled medical appointments. The dataset is made up of 14 unique variables.

Variables in this dataset includes(PatientId,AppointmentID,Gender,ScheduledDay,AppointmentDay,Age,Hipertension,Diabetes,Alcoholism, Handcap, SMS_received,Neighbourhood,Scholarship and No-show ). This analysis will be done using the No-show variable as our dependent variable while other variables will be used as independent varaibles.

Identifying factors responsible to no-show will definitely help Hospital better determine types of scheduled appointments to plan for and provide incentives that enables patient show up for their appointments. This analysis wont be using inferential statistics or machine learning so all findings are tentative.

This Project will be providing insights into the following qustions:

* What percentage of people showed up compared to those that didnt?

* Why Are People Not Showing Up?
* Does scholarship affect patient ability to show up?
* Does SMS alert impacts patient availability for their appointment?
* Is there any relationship between distance from patient neighbourhood to the hospital and their showing up for appointments?
* whats the time difference between a patient schedule date and his appointment date. What impact does this have on the patient ability to show up?
* Is there any relationship between patient age and their ability to show up?
* Does gender play any role in patient missing their appointment?
